# Wireframes

From the images above, chose a wireframe to guide your design for today's project. Remember that your final project must include:

- [x]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [x]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you.
- [x]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [x]  A `My Projects` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [x]  A `Contact Me` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [x]  Link navigation items to new HTML pages

Some choices are easier than others, pick something that feels right to you.
